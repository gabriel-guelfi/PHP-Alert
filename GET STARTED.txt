1. HOW DO I GET SET UP?

<?php

include $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]."/mysite/gadgets/phpalert/class.phpalert.php";
$alert = new PHPAlert("http://www.mysite.com/gadgets");

?>


2. SETTING UP AN ALERT

<?php

$alert->add("Hello World", "warning"); // You can add as many alerts you need. The gadget will create a queue with them.

?>

Alert types supported:

   . warning
   . success
   . failure



3. SHOWING UP ALERTS QUEUE

<?php

$alert->show(); // It will show the alerts registered in the queue, one by one. Each alert shown, takes 3 seconds to disappear automatically, then the next alert in queue will show up. And so on...

?>
